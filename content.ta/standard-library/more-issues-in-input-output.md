In Chapters 18 and 19 we saw how Console I/O and File I/O operations are done in C. There are still some more issues related with

input/output that remain to be understood. These issues help in making the I/O operations more elegant.

**Using _argc_ and _argv_** To execute the file-copy programs that we saw in Chapter 18, we are required to first type the program, compile it, and then execute it. This program can be improved in two ways:

- There should be no need to compile the program every time to use the file-copy utility. It means the program must be executable at command prompt(C:\\> if you are using command window, Start | Run dialog if you are using Windows and $ prompt if you are using UNIX).

- Instead of the program prompting us to enter the source and target filenames, we must be able to supply them at command prompt, in the form:
```
filecopy PR1.C PR2.C
```
where, PR1.C is the source filename and PR2.C is the target filename.

The first improvement is simple. In Visual Studio the executable file(the one which can be executed at command prompt and has an extension .EXE) can be created by using F7 to compile the program. In Turbo C/C++ the same can be done using F9. In UNIX this is not required since in UNIX, every time we compile a program, we always get an executable file.

The second improvement is possible by passing the source filename and target filename to the function **main()**. This is illustrated in the program given below.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main(int argc,char *argv)
{
    FILE *fs,*ft;
    char ch;
    if(argc != 3)
    { 
        puts("Improper number of arguments\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    fs=fopen(argv1,"r");
    if(fs==NULL)
    {
        puts("Cannot open source file\n");
        exit(2);
    } 
    ft = fopen(argv2,"w");
    if(ft == NULL)
    { 
        puts("Cannot open target file\n");
        fclose(fs);
        exit(3);
    } 
    while(1)
    {
        ch=fgetc(fs);
        if(ch==EOF)
        break;
        
        else
        fputc(ch,ft);
    }
    fclose(fs);
    fclose(ft);
    return0;
}

```

The arguments that we pass on to **main()** at the command prompt are called command-line arguments. The function **main()** can have two arguments, traditionally named as **argc** and **argv**. Out of these, **argv** is an array of pointers to strings and **argc** is an **int** whose value is equal to the number of strings to which **argv** points. When the program is executed, the strings on the command line are passed to **main()**. More precisely,

the strings at the command line are stored in memory and address of the first string is stored in **argv0**, address of the second string is stored in **argv1** and so on. The argument **argc** is set to the number of strings given on the command line. For example, in our sample program, if at the command prompt we give, filecopy PR1.C PR2.C then, **argc** would contain 3 **argv0** would contain base address of the string “filecopy” **argv1** would contain base address of the string “PR1.C” **argv2** would contain base address of the string “PR2.C”

Whenever we pass arguments to **main()**, it is a good habit to check whether the correct number of arguments have been passed on to **main()** or not. In our program this has been done through,
```
if(argc != 3)
{ 
    puts("Improper number of arguments\n");
    exit(1);
}
```

Rest of the program is same as the earlier file-copy program. This program is better than the earlier file-copy program on two counts:

- There is no need to recompile the program every time we want to use this utility. It can be executed at command prompt.

- We are able to pass source file name and target file name to **main()**, and utilize them in **main()**.

One final comment... the **while** loop that we have used in our program can be written in a more compact form, as shown below.
```
    while((ch = fgetc(fs)) != EOF)
    fputc(ch, ft);
```
This avoids the usage of an indefinite loop and a **break** statement to come out of this loop. Here, first **fgetc** **(fs)** gets the character from the file, assigns it to the variable **ch**, and then **ch** is compared against **EOF**. Remember that it is necessary to put the expression
```
ch = fgetc(fs)
```
within a pair of parentheses, so that first the character read is assigned to variable **ch** and then it is compared with **EOF**.

There is one more way of writing the **while** loop. It is shown below.

```
while(!feof(fs))
{
    ch = fgetc(fs);
    fputc(ch,ft);
}
```
Here, **feof()** is a macro which returns a 0 if end of file is not reached. Hence we use the **!** operator to negate this 0 to the truth value. When the end of file is reached, **feof(** **)** returns a non-zero value, **!** makes it 0 and since now the condition evaluates to false, the **while** loop gets terminated.

Note that in each one of them, the following three methods for opening a file are same, since in each one of them, essentially a base address of the string(pointer to a string) is being passed to **fopen()**.
```
    fs = fopen("PR1.C","r");
    fs=fopen(filename,"r");
    fs=fopen(argv1,"r");
```
**Detecting Errors in Reading/Writing** Not at all times when we perform a read or write operation on a file, are we successful in doing so. Naturally there must be a provision to test whether our attempt to read/write was successful or not.

The standard library function **ferror()** reports any error that might have occurred during a read/write operation on a file. It returns a zero if the read/write is successful and a non-zero value in case of a failure. The following program illustrates the usage of **ferror()**:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    FILE *fp;
    char ch;

    fp = fopen("TRIAL","w");
    while(!feof(fp))
    {
        ch=fgetc(fp);
        if(ferror())
        {
            printf("Errorinreadingfile\n");
            break;
        }
            else
            printf("%c",ch);
    }
    fclose(fp);
    return0;
}
```
In this program, the **fgetc()** function would obviously fail first time around since the file has been opened for writing, whereas **fgetc()** is attempting to read from the file. The moment the error occurs, **ferror()** returns a non-zero value and the **if** block gets executed. Instead of printing the error message using **printf()**, we can use the standard library function **perror()** which prints the error message specified by the compiler. Thus in the above program the **perror()** function can be used as shown below.

```
if(ferror())
{
    perror("TRIAL");
    break;
}
```
Note that when the error occurs, the error message that is displayed is:
```
TRIAL: Permission denied
```
This means we can precede the system error message with any message of our choice. In our program, we have just displayed the filename in place of the error message.

**Standard I/O Devices** To perform reading or writing operations on a file, we need to use the function **fopen()**, which sets up a file pointer to refer to this file. Most OSs also predefine pointers for three standard files. To access these pointers, we need not use **fopen()**. These standard file pointers are shown in Figure 20.1

### Standard File pointer Description

Figure 20.1

Thus the statement **ch = fgetc(stdin)** would read a character from the keyboard rather than from a file. We can use this statement without any need to use **fopen()** or **fclose()** function calls.

**I/O Redirection** Most operating systems incorporate a powerful feature that allows a program to read and write files, even when such a capability has not been incorporated in the program. This is done through a process called ‘redirection’.

Normally a C program receives its input from the standard input device, which is assumed to be the keyboard, and sends its output to the standard output device, which is assumed to be the VDU. In other words, the OS makes certain assumptions about where input should come from and where output should go. Redirection permits us to change these assumptions.

For example, using redirection the output of the program that normally goes to the VDU can be sent to the disk or the printer without really making a provision for it in the program. This is often a more convenient and flexible approach than providing a separate function in the program to write to the disk or printer. Similarly, redirection can be used to read information from disk file directly into a program, instead of receiving the input from keyboard.

To use redirection facility is to execute the program from the command prompt, inserting the redirection symbols at appropriate places. Let us understand this process with the help of a program.

### Redirecting the Output

Let’s see how we can redirect the output of a program, from the screen to a file. We’ll start by considering the simple program shown below.
```
//* File name: util.c 

#include<stdio.h>
int main() 
{ 
    char ch;
    while((ch = getc(stdin)) != EOF)
    putc(ch, stdout);
    return 0;
}
```
On compiling this program, we would get an executable file UTIL.EXE. Normally, when we execute this file, the **putc()** function will cause whatever we type to be printed on screen, until we type Ctrl-Z, at which point the program will terminate, as shown in the following sample run. The Ctrl-Z character is often called end of file character.

C>UTIL.EXE perhaps I had a wicked childhood, perhaps I had a miserable youth, but somewhere in my wicked miserable past, there must have been a moment of truth ^Z C>

Now let’s see what happens when we invoke this program from in a different way, using redirection:
```
C>UTIL.EXE > POEM.TXT C>
```
Here we are causing the output to be redirected to the file POEM.TXT. Can we prove that this output has indeed gone to the file POEM.TXT? Yes, by using the TYPE command as follows:

C>TYPE POEM.TXT perhaps I had a wicked childhood,

perhaps I had a miserable youth, but somewhere in my wicked miserable past, there must have been a moment of truth C>

There’s the result of our typing sitting in the file. The redirection operator, ‘>’, causes any output intended for the screen to be written to the file whose name follows the operator.

Note that the data to be redirected to a file doesn’t need to be typed by a user at the keyboard; the program itself can generate it. Any output normally sent to the screen can be redirected to a disk file. As an example, consider the following program for generating the ASCII table on screen:
```
//* File name: ascii.c

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int ch;
    for(ch = 0;ch<= 255;ch++)
    printf("%d %c\n",ch,ch);
    return 0;
}
```
When this program is compiled and then executed at command prompt using the redirection operator,
```
C>ASCII.EXE > TABLE.TXT
```
the output is written to the file. This can be a useful capability any time you want to capture the output in a file, rather than displaying it on the screen.

### Redirecting the Input

We can also redirect input to a program so that, instead of reading a character from the keyboard, a program reads it from a file. Let us now see how this can be done.

To redirect the input, we need to have a file containing something to be displayed. Suppose we use a file called NEWPOEM.TXT containing the following lines:

Let's start at the very beginning, A very good place to start!

We’ll assume that using some text editor these lines have been placed in the file NEWPOEM.TXT. Now, we use the input redirection operator ‘<’ before the file, as shown below.
```
C>UTIL.EXE< NEWPOEM.TXT Let's start at the very beginning, A very good place to start! C>
```
The lines are printed on the screen with no further effort on our part. Using redirection, we’ve made our program UTIL.C perform the work of the TYPE command.

### Both Ways at Once

Redirection of input and output can be used together; the input for a program can come from a file via redirection, at the same time its output can be redirected to a file. Such a program is called a filter. The following command demonstrates this process:
```
C>UTIL.EXE< NEWPOEM.TXT > POETRY.TXT
```
In this case, our program receives the redirected input from the file NEWPOEM.TXT and instead of sending the output to the screen; it would redirect it to the file POETRY.TXT.

While using such multiple redirections, don’t try to send output to the same file from which you are receiving input. This is because the output file is erased before it is written to. So by the time we manage to receive the input from a file, it is already erased.

Redirection can be a powerful tool for developing utility programs to examine or alter data in files. Thus, redirection is used to establish a relationship between a program and a file. Another OS operator can be used to relate two programs directly, so that the output of one is fed directly into another, with no files involved. This is called ‘piping’, and is done using the operator ‘|’, called pipe. We won’t pursue this topic, but you can read about it in the OS Help.

### Summary

- We can pass parameters to a program at command line using the concept of ‘command-line arguments’.

- The command line argument **argv** contains values passed to the program, whereas, **argc** contains number of arguments.

- We can use the standard file pointer **stdin** to take input from standard input device, such as keyboard.

- We can use the standard file pointer **stdout** to send output to the standard output device, such as a monitor.

- Redirection allows a program to read from or write to files at command prompt.

- The operators **<** and **\>** are called redirection operators.

### Exercise

**A** Answer the following:

- How will you use the following program to:

- Copy the contents of one file into another.

- Create a new file and add some text to it.

- Display the contents of an existing file.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char ch,str10;
    while((ch = getc(stdin)) != -1)
    putc(ch, stdout);
    return 0;
}
```
- State True or False:

1\. We can send arguments at command line even if we define **main()** function without parameters.

2\. To use standard file pointers we don’t need to open the file using **fopen()**.

3\. The zeroth element of the **argv** array is always the name of the executable file.

- Point out the errors, if any, in the following program:
```c
# include<stdio.h>
int main(int ac, char(*)av)
{
    printf("%d\n",ac);
    printf("%s\n",av0);
    return 0;
}
```
**B** Attempt the following:

- Write a program using command line arguments to search for a word in a file and replace it with the specified word. The usage of the program is shown below.
```
C> change<old word><new word><filename>
```
- Write a program that can be used at command prompt as a calculating utility. The usage of the program is shown below.
```
C> calc<switch><n><m>
```
Where, **n** and **m** are two integer operands. **switch** can be any one of the arithmetic or comparison operators. If arithmetic operator is supplied, the output should be the result of the operation. If comparison operator is supplied then the output should be **True** or **False**.
