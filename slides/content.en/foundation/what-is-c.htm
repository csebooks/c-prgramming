        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Procedural Language: C is a procedural programming language, which means it follows a top-down approach in program design.</li>
            <li>Low-Level: C provides a high degree of control over hardware, making it suitable for system programming and embedded systems.</li>
            <li>Portability: Code written in C can be compiled for different platforms with minimal changes, thanks to its portability.</li>
            <li>Efficiency: C is known for its efficiency and is often used for performance-critical applications.</li>
            <li>Syntax: C has a simple and elegant syntax. It uses a combination of keywords and punctuation, making it highly readable and expressive.</li>
            <li>Standard Libraries: C comes with a standard library that provides functions and macros for performing various tasks, from I/O operations to mathematical calculations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating Systems: Many operating systems are written in C or have components written in C (e.g., Unix, Linux).</li>
            <li>Embedded Systems: C is prevalent in embedded systems like microcontrollers and IoT devices.</li>
            <li>Game Development: It's used for game development, especially in writing game engines.</li>
            <li>Compiler Development: C is often used to develop compilers and interpreters for other languages.</li>
        </ul>
