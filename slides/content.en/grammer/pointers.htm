    <h1>Understanding Pointers in C</h1>
    <p>Briefly introduce the topic and its importance for C programming.</p>
    <p>Mention that this chapter focuses on pointers and their usage in function calls.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 2: Call by Value and Call by Reference -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Call by Value and Call by Reference</h1>

    <p>Show code examples illustrating the two concepts.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 3: An Introduction to Pointers -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>An Introduction to Pointers</h1>
    <p>Introduce the basics of pointers, highlighting the importance of understanding pointers.</p>
    <p>Explain C's "address of" and "value at address" operators using code examples.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 4: Pointer Notation -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Pointer Notation</h1>
    <p>Describe how C's pointer notation works, using an example with a variable declaration.</p>
    <p>Explain how memory addresses and values are related to pointers.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 5: Using Address-of Operator (&) -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Using the Address-of Operator (&)</h1>
    <p>Explain how to use the '&' operator to retrieve the memory address of a variable.</p>
    <p>Show a code example that prints the address of a variable.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 6: Using Value at Address Operator (*) -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Using the Value at Address Operator (*)</h1>
    <p>Explain how the '*' operator allows you to access the value stored at a specific memory address.</p>
    <p>Provide a code example illustrating this concept.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 7: Declaring Pointer Variables -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Declaring Pointer Variables</h1>
    <p>Explain how to declare pointer variables, including int, char, and float pointers.</p>
    <p>Highlight that pointer variables store memory addresses.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 8: Pointer to a Pointer -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Pointer to a Pointer</h1>
    <p>Introduce the concept of a pointer that contains the address of another pointer.</p>
    <p>Provide a code example with int, int pointer, and int pointer-to-pointer declarations.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 9: Practical Example of Pointers -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Practical Example of Pointers</h1>
    <p>Show a code example that demonstrates the relationships between variables with different pointer levels.</p>
    <p>Illustrate the usage of pointer-to-pointer and the relationships between them.</p>

<!-- Slide 10: Function Calls - Call by Value and Call by Reference -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Function Calls - Call by Value and Call by Reference</h1>
    <p>Explain how function calls can be made using "call by value" and "call by reference."</p>
    <p>Present code examples that show the difference between these two approaches.</p>
</section>

<!-- Slide 11: Using Call by Reference to Return Multiple Values -->
<section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
    <h1>Using Call by Reference to Return Multiple Values</h1>
    <p>Demonstrate how call by reference allows a function to return multiple values simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Present a code example where a function returns area and perimeter values using call by reference.</p>
</section>
