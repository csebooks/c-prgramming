Grammar:
The Grammar unit focuses on high-level programming concepts in the C language, equipping students with essential skills and knowledge to write effective and efficient code.

Data Structures:
This module covers fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Students will learn the principles behind these structures and gain hands-on experience implementing them in C. Understanding data structures is crucial for organizing and manipulating data efficiently.

Control Structures:
Students will explore control structures like loops and conditional statements, essential for building algorithms and decision-making processes in programs. Through practical examples and exercises, they will grasp the logic behind these structures and learn to apply them effectively.

Functions and Pointers:
This section delves into the concepts of functions and pointers, pivotal features of C programming. Students will learn how to create and use functions to modularize code, enhancing readability and reusability. Understanding pointers, including dynamic memory allocation, is crucial for managing memory resources efficiently.
