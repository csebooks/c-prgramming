The Standard Library unit focuses on essential libraries in C, enabling students to leverage pre-built functions and modules to simplify their programming tasks.

String Handling:
This module explores string manipulation functions provided by the C Standard Library. Students will learn how to create, manipulate, and compare strings using functions like strlen(), strcpy(), and strcat(). Mastery of string handling is fundamental for text processing and data manipulation tasks.

Input/Output Operations:
Students will delve into input and output operations in C, understanding functions like printf(), scanf(), fprintf(), and fscanf(). This knowledge is crucial for reading data from users, files, and other sources, as well as displaying output in various formats.

File Handling:
In this section, students will learn how to work with files in C, including operations like opening, reading, writing, and closing files. They will understand file streams, enabling them to create, modify, and manage files effectively.
